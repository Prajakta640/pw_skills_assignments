        "**Answer**-  Method chaining in Python allows you to call multiple methods on the same object in a single line, which can improve code readability and conciseness. It works by ensuring each method returns the object itself (self), allowing for multiple operations on the same object without needing intermediate variables. This technique is particularly useful for building fluent interfaces and can help make your code more elegant and streamlined."

        "**Answer**- The __call__ method in Python is a special method that allows an object to be called as if it were a function. This means that you can make instances of a class behave like functions by implementing the __call__ method in the class.\n",
        "\n",
        "The __call__ method in Python is a special method that makes an object callable like a function. By implementing __call__, you can define custom behavior for objects that are invoked with parentheses. This allows for flexible and elegant designs, especially when you want to encapsulate function-like behavior within an object while preserving its state and additional methods."
