It is used for debugging, monitoring, and recording errors or other significant occurrences in an application. Why Use Logging Instead of Print? 1) More Control: Logging allows different levels of messages (info, warning, error, etc.). 2) Persistence: Logs can be written to files for later analysis. 3) Custom Formatting: You can format logs with timestamps and other details. 4) Flexible Output: Logs can be sent to files, consoles, or external services. Python’s logging module is powerful, flexible, and a better alternative to print() for debugging and tracking application behavior in production."

Multiprocessing is a system that has more than one or two processors. In Multiprocessing, CPUs are added to increase the computing speed of the system. Because of Multiprocessing, There are many processes are executed simultaneously. Multithreading is a system in which multiple threads are created of a process for increasing the computing speed of the system. In multithreading, many threads of a process are executed simultaneously and process creation in multithreading is done according to economical. To summerise, Multiprocessing and multithreading are techniques used to improve computing efficiency. Multiprocessing uses multiple CPUs to do multiprocessing while multithreading uses multiple threads within a single process to increase performance of the system."
